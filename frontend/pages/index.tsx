        SoroSplits is a set of smart contracts & interfaces to enable split
        transactions and revenue sharing across multiple parties in the Stellar
        ecosystem.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        The core functionality of the smart contract would allow any assets
        that exist on Stellar to be split in a trustless, automated, &
        transparent way across addresses and the user interface would enable all
        Stellar community members & projects to leverage the technology as a
        public good.
