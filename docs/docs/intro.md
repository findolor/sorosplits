# Welcome to SoroSplits

Welcome to SoroSplits, the premier platform for equitable and automated token distribution on the Soroban network. SoroSplits leverages the power of smart contracts to revolutionize the way tokens are allocated and distributed among stakeholders. Our platform is designed with transparency, security, and efficiency at its core, ensuring that every participant receives their fair share without the need for manual intervention.
Our Mission

At SoroSplits, our mission is to simplify the process of token distribution for organizations, DAOs, and investment groups. We aim to provide a trustless environment where the distribution of assets is governed by immutable rules set within our smart contracts. Our goal is to eliminate the complexities and potential for human error that come with traditional distribution methods.

## Features & Benefits

- **Automated Distribution**: With SoroSplits, token distributions are executed automatically, based on the predefined shares stored securely on the blockchain.
- **Immutable Contracts**: Once initialized, the Splitter Contract's parameters are set in stone, providing a stable and predictable distribution mechanism.
- **Transparent Operations**: Every transaction and modification within the contract is visible on the blockchain, ensuring complete transparency for all parties involved.
- **Admin Oversight**: While the contract enforces rules autonomously, administrative controls are in place for the initialization and potential updates to the contract, should the need arise.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: SoroSplits provides an intuitive interface for both administrators and shareholders to interact with the contract, making it accessible to users with varying levels of blockchain experience.

<!-- ## Getting Started with SoroSplits

To begin using SoroSplits, you'll need to deploy the Splitter Contract on the Stellar network. Once deployed, the contract will guide you through the process of initializing your distribution parameters. After the initial setup, shareholders can easily query their shares, and authorized parties can trigger distributions as needed.
